The Center is a multifunction community center focused on population specific programming for LGTBQ folks in the Anytown region.  The Center intends to offer more services in-house in the coming year(s), and may become hindered by technological issues with this growth.
Their business case appropriate for the 42U programming challenge centers around their Programs and their CyberCenter, both of which track attendees via sign-in sheets, as well as tallies of referrals made at these events or at the front desk. Moving the sign-ins and tallies into FileMaker should yield easier reporting and metrics, plus easier ability to do data entry on mobile devices at outreach events or community fairs etc. as well as at check-in desks inside The Center itself.
